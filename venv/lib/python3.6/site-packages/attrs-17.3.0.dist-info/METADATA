``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder <https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html>`_ methods).

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. -spiel-end-

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import attr

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class SomeClass(object):
   ...     a_number = attr.ib(default=42)
   ...     list_of_numbers = attr.ib(default=attr.Factory(list))
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> attr.asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a complete set of comparison methods,
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing ``tuple``\ s or `confusingly behaving <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#namedtuples>`_ ``namedtuple``\ s.
Which in turn encourages you to write *small classes* that do `one thing well <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries>`_.
Never again violate the `single responsibility principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_ just because implementing ``__init__`` et al is a painful drag.

Testimonials
============

**Amber Hawkie Brown**, Twisted Release Manager and Computer Owl:

  Writing a fully-functional class using attrs takes me less time than writing this testimonial.


**Glyph Lefkowitz**, creator of `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_, `Automat <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Automat>`_, and other open source software, in `The One Python Library Everyone Needs <https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2016/08/attrs.html>`_:

  I’m looking forward to is being able to program in Python-with-attrs everywhere.
  It exerts a subtle, but positive, design influence in all the codebases I’ve see it used in.


**Kenneth Reitz**, author of `requests <http://www.python-requests.org/>`_, Python Overlord at Heroku, `on paper no less <https://twitter.com/hynek/status/866817877650751488>`_:

  attrs—classes for humans.  I like it.


**Łukasz Langa**, prolific CPython core developer and Production Engineer at Facebook:

  I'm increasingly digging your attr.ocity. Good job!

Release Information
===================

17.3.0 (2017-11-08)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Attributes are not defined on the class body anymore.

  This means that if you define a class ``C`` with an attribute ``x``, the class will *not* have an attribute ``x`` for introspection anymore.
  Instead of ``C.x``, use ``attr.fields(C).x`` or look at ``C.__attrs_attrs__``.
  The old behavior has been deprecated since version 16.1.
  (`#253 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/253>`_)


Changes
^^^^^^^

- ``super()`` and ``__class__`` now work on Python 3 when ``slots=True``.
  (`#102 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/102>`_, `#226 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/226>`_, `#269 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/269>`_, `#270 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/270>`_, `#272 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/272>`_)
- Added ``type`` argument to ``attr.ib()`` and corresponding ``type`` attribute to ``attr.Attribute``.

  This change paves the way for automatic type checking and serialization (though as of this release ``attrs`` does not make use of it).
  In Python 3.6 or higher, the value of ``attr.Attribute.type`` can alternately be set using variable type annotations
  (see `PEP 526 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/>`_). (`#151 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/151>`_, `#214 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/214>`_, `#215 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/215>`_, `#239 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/239>`_)
- The combination of ``str=True`` and ``slots=True`` now works on Python 2.
  (`#198 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/198>`_)
- ``attr.Factory`` is hashable again. (`#204
  <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/204>`_)
- Subclasses now can overwrite attribute definitions of their superclass.

  That means that you can -- for example -- change the default value for an attribute by redefining it.
  (`#221 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/221>`_, `#229 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/229>`_)
- Added new option ``auto_attribs`` to ``@attr.s`` that allows to collect annotated fields without setting them to ``attr.ib()``.

  Setting a field to an ``attr.ib()`` is still possible to supply options like validators.
  Setting it to any other value is treated like it was passed as ``attr.ib(default=value)`` -- passing an instance of ``attr.Factory`` also works as expected.
  (`#262 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/262>`_, `#277 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/277>`_)
- Instances of classes created using ``attr.make_class()`` can now be pickled.
  (`#282 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/282>`_)

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `sub-classing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
